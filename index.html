    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a new begining, trying to see how far I can master HTML5 & CSS in the next 48 hours</p>
  <p>Starting from 8:00 PM IST</p>
  <p>git version check</p>
  <h1>!</h1>
  <h2>!</h2>
  <h3>!</h3>
  <h4>!</h4>
  <h5>!</h5>
  <p>so this is br and hr tag</p>
  <br>
  <hr>
  <pre>and this is preformatted paragraphs
    no need for br tags here 
    hmm it's definitely personal choice
    I personally like this seems prefect 
    for one-time-blogs where I don't 
    need to keep formatting it,
    will see whats more to come
